    Shared coding conventions allow teams to collaborate effectively. This rule checks that all file names match a
    provided regular expression.
</p>
<p>As JSON files are used in a large variety of ways and by many frameworks, it might sometimes be tricky to enforce a
    strict file naming convention. However, the default regular expression has been designed to match as closely as
    possible the following guidelines:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Suffix files with <code>.json</code></li>
    <li>Only use letters, digits, '_' and '-' characters</li>
    <li>Refrain from using '_' and '-' characters. Only use them when mandatory.</li>
    <li>Extensively use Camel Case. For example, prefer:
<pre>
myObject.json
</pre>
        to
<pre>
myobject.json
my_object.json
</pre>
    </li>
</ul>
