<p>Some tools such as Git work better when files end with an empty line.</p>
<p>This rule simply generates an issue if it is missing.</p>
<p>For example, a Git diff looks like:</p>
<pre>
{
  "key": "value"
}
\ No newline at end of file
</pre>
<p>if the empty line is missing at the end of the file.</p>
