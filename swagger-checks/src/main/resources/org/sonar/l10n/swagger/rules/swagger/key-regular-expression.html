<p>This rule template can be used to create rules which will be triggered when a key matches a given regular
    expression.
</p>
<p>
    For example, one can create a rule with the regular expression <code>.*error.*</code> to match all key containing
    "error". Note that, in order to match "error" regardless of the case, the <code>(?i)</code> modifier can be
    prepended to the expression, as in <code>(?i).*error.*</code>.
